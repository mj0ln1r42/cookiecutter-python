Welcome to the {{ cookiecutter.project_name }} Tests!

This project uses [PyTest](https://docs.pytest.org/) to execute tests in the [`/tests`]({{ cookiecutter.repo_url }}/tests) directory.
Our tests are divided into various flavors ie `/unit_tests`, `/integration_tests`, et al at this level.
PyTest can be invoked manually to run tests from the CLI, or tests can be run from the testing tab in VSCode.

TODO: we should add test coverage reporting here as well
