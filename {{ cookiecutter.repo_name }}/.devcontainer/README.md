Welcome to the {{ cookiecutter.project_name }} Dev Container!

## Initial Setup
To begin developing in this container, you'll first need to seolve these two riddles:
1. Install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/), or [Rancher Desktop](https://rancherdesktop.io) (and make sure it's running.)
2. Install the "Remote Development" extension pack by Microsoft in VSCode. (It should have been recommended to you already by VSCode itself.)

## Running the Dev Container
Running the container is easy, just click on the green box in the bottom left of the VSCode IDE and click "Reopen in Container". Boom, bam, you're ready to go.
